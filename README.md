## 2do...

1. Instead of FB-Only, install multiple Social Network icons.
2. Install FullPage/POP-UP & Invisible/Hidden ADs.
3. Card using PP/CC - javascript-tooltip license for nitul.net to avoid reminder notifications (http://www.menucool.com/tooltip/javascript-tooltip)
4. Write contents for: "Learn More" & "@N" to replace tip2 & tip1...
5. Create simple tooltip for other links like: Hide ADs, Go Fullscreen, Change Video, etc etc-- to tell user detail abot the function, like for "Go Fullscreen" - tell user if it doesn't work, they can always use F11 button to fullscreen it, and after going fullscreen they can press "ESC" anytime to exit it.
