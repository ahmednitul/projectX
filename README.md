@ CHANNELs: create a new template based on the original but rename 'learn more...' to 'fullscreen +/-' button and instead of full-screen, show "SWITCH CHANNEL" ... on-hover, display other channels offered; also the main index randomly redirects between all available channels - show channel-logo on top with 5% margin/space then rotate between left/center/right and have 5% margin/space on both left/right so its placed perfectltly.

0. PAID/FREE - enable javascript countdown on page-load and display element 'x' after x seconds passed (usually 30/60 minutes) which lock-out the screen and show upgrade/login/trial options, upon upgrades-- show them diffrent version under protected folder 'vip' which have no-ads and does not lock the screen, simple membership/access management module using .htaccess - create/delete user/pass using API.

5. Create simple tooltip for other links like: Hide ADs, Go Fullscreen, Change Video, etc etc-- to tell user detail abot the function, like for "Go Fullscreen" - tell user if it doesn't work, they can always use F11 button to fullscreen it, and after going fullscreen they can press "ESC" anytime to exit it.

6. Create separate "UIX" for Mobile (small displays) but not Tablets and other large screens, then setup an auto-redirector to send mobile visitors to their specific URLs, for Apple devices- and others that doesn't support player playback, display ADs then redirect to the video sources.

7. Place roll-out and roll-in effect enabled sticky ajax ADs Unit on middle-rightside (where currently displaying LiveChat) and move live-chat to bottom-right (ovrtlaying Sponsored By text, as thats not important and live-chat only displays when "Online") --- place skyscrapper (160x60) and doubble ractangle-box (350x350) or (250x250) ads on the right-side--- and make it roll-out every x seconds and upon closing, it rolls-in but then again re-rollout after x seconds.

8. Setup .htaccess match-rewrite code in the proxy to redirect all traffics that returned to the porn720's home-page (when video is not found) then redirect it to an static mp4 file.
